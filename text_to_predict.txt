Floods are natural disasters characterized by the overflow of water onto normally dry land, often caused by heavy rainfall, overflowing rivers, rapid snowmelt, or dam failures. They can occur suddenly, as in flash floods, or develop gradually over days or weeks. Floods have devastating impacts on communities, including the loss of lives, destruction of property, displacement of people, and damage to infrastructure such as roads and bridges. Additionally, floods can lead to long-term issues like waterborne diseases and contamination of drinking water supplies. While floods are a natural part of many ecosystems, human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and poor land management can exacerbate their frequency and severity. Effective flood management strategies, including building flood defenses, improving drainage systems, and creating early warning systems, are essential to mitigate their impact.
